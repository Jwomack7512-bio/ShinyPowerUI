br() function that can enter number of spacings. (becuase doing br() 3-5 times is ugly)

hr() with styling options

titlePanel from pahMOdels

we learned how to play with the translate fxn to move title around, apply to titlepanel and hrtitle.
title_align but have custom translate_x, translate_y to override.

Need to change "titlePanel name as it conflicts with base shiny"
